Tokyo weather data from 1981-2021

-overall increase in yearly maximim, minimum, and average temperatures
	-some years see a sharp decline in temperature
		-max T (1982, 1988-1989, 1993,1999,2003,2009)
		-highest min T (1993, 2003, 2009, 2016)
		-

Analyzed maximum temperature data from Tokyo (1981-2021) and used the historical data to predict the daily maximum temperature for the next 3 years (2021-2024).

modules used:

*pandas
-grouped maximum, average, and minimum temp by year
-split historical data into training: 1981-01-01 to 2018-12-31 and test: 2019-01-01 to 2021-09-27 using loc


*numpy

*seaborn
-boxplots to look at the daily range in maximum-minimum temperature by year
-boxplots to look at daily maximum temperature grouped by year

*matplotlib
-line plots of maximum, average, and minimum temp by year
-histogram of max temperature
-plot validation data against predicted data

*xgboost
-used XGBRegressor to look at feature importance and forecast 3 years out from 2018-12-31 
=base_score = 0.5
=booster = 'gbtree'
=n_estimators = 1000
=objective = 'reg:squarederror'
=max_depth = 3
=learning_rate = 0.01

-first, fit the model using only the training split to see how well it performs
-fit the model using all of the data, assess the performance, forecast 3 years out

*sklearn
-TimeSeriesSplit cross validation (5 splits)

*statistics

*datetime

first forecast w/ 3 lag features was 1 day, 2 years, 3 years - the model predictions was overfitting to the quarter (Jan 2021-March 2021) of validation data and forecasting anomolously and increasingly low temperatures for the next three years

revised the lag features to be 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15 years. the predicted data generally follows the trend of the Jan 2021-March 2021 max temperature data withou the previous overfitting concerns. The forecast now shows more accurate max temperature predictions.
